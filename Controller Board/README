The controller board will ONLY work with 2.41" displays that use an SSD1305 controller IC, as this is the only one that can communicate via I2C
In addition, modifications must be made to the display for it to work. There is a set of jumpers on the back of the board, labelled BS1 and BS2

The jumpers must be set to the following positions:
BS1 - 1
BS2 - 0

This puts the display into I2C mode, and allows it to communicate with the shield
